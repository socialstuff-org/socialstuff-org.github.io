##Description
The reporting service handles the reporting system. This includes administrative tasks like managing for which reasons 
users can be reported, as well as the reporting system itself (reporting users and banning them). 
The administrative tasks, like adding new report reasons, manually blocking and unblocking users, can be done via the 
[settings service](settings.md).
